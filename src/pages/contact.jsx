        <div className="content-section center-text">
          <span>It's Monday morning, but you wake up with a sleepy smile.</span>
          <span>You roll over and get out of bed but you aren't in a rush. </span>
          <span>Maybe you go out to that new coffee shop you've been meaning to check out and grab some breakfast.</span>
          <span>Maybe you take your laptop and maybe you don't.</span>
          <span>It's all up to you because you own your own business and the workday starts (and ends) when say it does because, well, you're the boss. </span>
          <span>Sounds pretty good right?</span>
          <span>The amazing thing is that this (or whatever your version of a dream morning is) is available to you (even on a Monday).</span>
          <span>And it's <u>so</u> much closer than you think! </span>
          <span>I've been where you are before and I figured out how to get to the other side (and helped others do the same)</span>
          <span>I used to dread waking up on Mondays (and all weekdays for that matter) and rushing to a job that I wasn't exactly thrilled to be doing in the first place.</span> 
          <span>I remember what it's like and it was <u>NOT</u> fun.</span>

        </div>
        <div className="content-section center-text">
          <span>I wanted to help the creative and ambitious (but maybe a little bit stuck) go from drifting through life without a purpose to living a life they love (and the one they <u>DESERVE</u> if we're being honest here).</span>
          <span>I wanted to take their professional lives from ðŸ˜¬ to ðŸ˜Ž</span>
          <span>I wanted to take everything I've learned over the past few years about personal development and combine it with the best project management techniques borrowed from the tech field (you know, the ones companies like Google and AirBnB use to zoom past the competition and acheive INSANE things quicker than anyone thought was possible) to turbo charge your transformation so you don't have to waste a minute longer than you have to in a life you aren't thrilled with.</span>
          <span>It's like business coaching on rocket fuel ðŸš€</span>

          <span>That's a question only you can answer.</span>
          <span>You have to ask yourself if it's worth the price to get from where you currently are to where you want to be in the next three months.</span>
          <span>I get it, investing in yourself is always scary. But if you think about it, betting on yourself is the surest bet you can make (because you control what you do)!</span>
